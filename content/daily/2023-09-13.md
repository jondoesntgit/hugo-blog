## Ask StackOverflow about next steps for hard-drive recovery

I'm not expecting much, but this is what I posted: [Recovering data from iMac internal hard drive when you can't login to your account anymore](https://superuser.com/questions/1808396/recovering-data-from-imac-internal-hard-drive-when-you-cant-login-to-your-accou)

## Website with nice blog format

Basically, use [Hugo Book](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app) as a main template, but with the following modifications: the table of contents from [LoveIt](https://hugoloveit.com/theme-documentation-basics/), a cute customized SVG of my face in the style of [Hugo Refresh](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-refresh/), with asides in the style of [Buttericks Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/why-does-typography-matter.html) and using [AlmeidaCV](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/almeida-cv/) this as a reference for my CV if I ever make it.

## Bed Remodel

I spent too much time working on the bed remodel. As I was working, all of a sudden, my model disappeared. I tried to manually adjust the camera settings in the save file, but I was never able to get the model to come back. It looks like I'll have to re-do a lot of work. FreeCAD is such a finicky program. It probably makese sense to make lots of incremental backups of a FreeCAD file to avoid this in the future.

I increased the default number of backup files to 10 under preferences -> document.

Today was a good day. I tried to set smaller expectations for what I was going to accomplish, which I think was a good thing. I'm finding it's better to make plans to get a few things done, but nail those things, than to make plans to get a bunch of things done and get none of them done.

Also, with my spare time today, I had some time to try to model some home improvements that I want to do. I'll place my notes here until I figure out a better place in this Hugo Blog (or elsewhere under my jamwheeler.com domain), and when I do figure out where to put it, I'll leave a link here.

Other fluff:

Spent some time modeling a new bed. It will have some office space on the second level, and accomodate an existing mattress (full size) that we have. We will use information from the following tutorials:

- [Woodworking with FreeCAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfNBfdIpzDQ)

The mattress is an IKEA full-sized [](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/matrand-memory-foam-mattress-firm-white-10272397/#content). It is 74-3/8" long, 53-1/8" wide, and 7-1/8" tall. We start then by modeling the frame around the mattress, and then build up to a plywood loft above it.

I need to make my S3 work with HTTPS.... Anyway, we'll work more on that tomorrow. It's bed time now.

No 123 for today.

I got sick and tired yesterday, and spent time googling instead of journaling.

From this, I learned two lessons. The first is a lesson that teachers know. When you get sick, you still have to write down your lesson plans for tomorrow even though you're still sick. Just curling up in a corner and not tying up loose ends sounds relaxing, but you (and your substitute teacher) will wish that you didn't. You don't always have to do the full planning. Just enough to tie up where you were.

Second, I learned that procrastination is only okay when you have lots of time and energy. At the end of the day, when you're low on energy and out of time, you cannot say "oh, I'll do that later." I need to make this daily planning and reflecting habit something that is natural and easy enough that I can squeeze it in every day in the evening in 5 minutes.

Tomorrow is Sabbath, and we are going on a church camp out. I don't know what Sunday will look like, so I'll probably plan to take it easy.

I'm thinking of storing some of my Bible study notes (and any other notes) and research on a Media Wiki that I self-host. 

Once I made the ULine account, I think I realized that really what I'm looking for are one or two small parts storage bins, which run around $45 used or new.

## Using Mitochondria to Date the Origin of the Species

Mitochondria are little organelles that live inside of the cells of most animals, plants, and fungi. Evolutionary theory says that they originally were prokaryotes that existed out in the wild by themselves, and somehow one of them managed to squiggle its way into a host cell. The mitochondrion produced lots of energy via aerobic respiration for its host cell (which was very good for the host cell) and the host cell provided a safe environment for the mitochondrion (which was very good for the mitochondrion). The elevated fitness of this arrangement allowed this symbiotic pair to thrive, and is an explanation for why virtually all complex life on the planet consists of eukaryotic cells with mitochondria in them. 

The DNA in mitochondria is separate and distinct from the DNA of its host cell. And while most complex life reproduces via sexua

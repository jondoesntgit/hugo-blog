I didn't make a plan for today. I stayed up too late last evening, and didn't make a plan when I woke up this morning. I'm writing this entry on the 19th as I work on getting back in the saddle.

Some lessons learned:

- Sometimes my work asks me to do things that I don't get a charge number for. These should be my small tasks for the day.
- If you want to add a new habit, you're going to have to commit a small task to it for a couple days in a row. Eventually, once this is part of your routine, you can stop making it your small task.
- Think of small tasks as the currency for life change. You only get to spend 3 points of small tasks on changes at a time. No huge changes. Over time, you can automate things (either with a computer, or just make them part of your daily routine)
- I need to give some more thought to how to think of medium tasks. It feels like you should have one high-priority big task that you work on first thing in the morning (Asian Efficiency calls this "eating your frog"), and then a second medium task that is work related. Then you have perhaps one personal "medium" task that you do in the evening. Ideally this should be a hobby, but I think that chores probably wind up using this task in busy seasons.
- Perhaps I need to make a rule that at least one of your 6 daily tasks must be something you enjoy doing.

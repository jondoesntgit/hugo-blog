I stayed up too late on 2023-09-13, which impacted getting a head start on my day in the morning. Also, my wife had some errands to run in the afternoon, so I was watching Matthew instead of handling some of the tasks that I was anticipating doing. I think this just means that I need to have my calendar open when I graph out what I'm going to do the next day.

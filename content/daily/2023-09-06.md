Two day streak now. Doing this 1-2-3 technique with kids always means that you have some unexpected things come up, like when your kid wakes up 40 minutes earlier than usual, and uses up the time you were planning for one of your medium tasks.

Another thing that I've empirically discovered about the 1-2-3 method is that small tasks can be used to "start" a task just to break the friction on it. I've been needing to call AT&T for a while. I planned to call them this evening, but they're closed. But I now have a call entry in my recent call history which should make it easier for tomorrow.

Also, I'm considering a small adjustment to the format of these blogs. Every day, I'll write a post (like this one) commenting on the goals from yesterday, but instead of putting tomorrow's list at the bottom of the entry, I'll make a new post for the following day. At the end of the following day, I'll write my post below it.

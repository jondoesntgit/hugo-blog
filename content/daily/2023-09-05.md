Welp, I failed to write my entry for yesterday. But I guess that’s okay. Unless you’re somebody’s employer, you generally don’t like watching somebody execute something perfectly. IT can be a little discouraging to feel like everyone around you is perfect and you’re the only screwed up person. So for everyone out there (except my employer), look! I failed at my goals from two days ago.

What I learned in the process is that part of what makes the 1-2-3 method work is timeboxing. It’s not enough to just identify the tasks that you want to do, you need to have a game plan of when you’re going to get them done. “Sometime” isn’t an option for setting a alarm clock, and neither is it an option for starting a concrete task.

So here we go at this a second time. The list for tomorrow:

```
[ ] (B) Write an important document at my day job (08:00)
[ ] (M) Inbox 0 Omnifocus (17:30)
[ ] (M) Organize the den (19:00)
[ ] (S) Collapse Matthew’s Pack & Play (06:45)
[ ] (S) Update AT&T billing information (17:45)
[ ] (S) Write journal entry for tomorrow (18:45)
```
